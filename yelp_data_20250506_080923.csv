The servers were nice and the food came out in 5-10 minutes. \n\nAs expected the food was good. The pork belly had good flavor but on the dryer side. The garlic rice was savory and a great base to the rest of the food. The ube pancake was sweet with a hint of coconut. The sweet pork sausage was one of my favorites. The beef lumpia was good but the veggie lumpia was better.

There's a tablet by the front door that you can put your name down on a waitlist, and it gives you an estimate of how long it might take for your party to get called. My friends and I arrived around dinner time and it took us 15min to get a table, but the parties after us started seeing much longer wait times. The dining area overall is on the smaller side, with it being a long and narrow space with essentially two rows of tables. The way the space was decorated with the artwork on the walls and lanterns hanging above your heads made it feel chaotic but in the way that it might remind you of actually being in China, which yes, is a good thing (iykyk).\n\nService - wait staff was very friendly and I think they did a wonderful job of handling every customer during a hectic dinner rush. Our food also came out so fast that I was shocked. But, given that the restaurant specializes in this particular type of noodle, I wasn't surprised. \n\nFood - oh my gosh. This stuff was so, so good. If you're expecting egg noodles or rice noodles or anything you'd get from any other Chinese restaurant, think again. If you come to this restaurant, expect long and wide noodles that take multiple slurps and bites to finish. I think I counted maybe 5 pieces of these noodles, and quite frankly it was extremely filling. This spot is known for the spicy dishes, but they offer non-spicy too, which is what I ordered. The bowl is packed not only with this special noodle type, but the other contents in the bowl were outstanding. The meat just slid right off the bone. The soup was packed with veggies, and the half egg was a nice touch. The only critique I will give was that I felt the soup was a little too salty. But, given that I just finished a hike earlier that day, a bit of salt felt needed. On any other day, though, I'd maybe water it down just a touch.\n\nNeedless to say, I will be coming back."", 'language': 'en'}, 'feedback': {'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0}, 'photos': [{'link': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y5IemTI8r5kqyWe-LO7gbw/o.jpg', 'caption': 'Non-spicy beef soup noodles'}, {'link': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BGeoE4UzRyT2jVqKJz64ew/o.jpg', 'caption': 'Dining area'}], 'tags': ['2 photos']}, {'position': 4, 'rating': 4, 'date': '2025-04-17T03:41:28Z', 'user': {'name': 'Lee W.', 'user_id': 'nCQktVaqgc1-6qy6mcR2kA', 'link': 'https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nCQktVaqgc1-6qy6mcR2kA', 'thumbnail': 'https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/V3O7YyxsJSD45iZZCaR-Mw/180s.jpg', 'address': 'Westchester County, NY', 'friends': 265, 'photos': 159, 'reviews': 37, 'elite_year': 25}, 'comment': {'text': ""Wasn't feeling great so I got some spicy soup & wings delivered.

The sashimi was the highlight of the night, and I loved the acidity of the dressing. I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato on the salmon dish, and my partner and I both felt that entree portions were rather small. We also ordered dessert, and our server didn't acknowledge that we were dining in for a special occasion.

My wife got the NY strip on the hot stone with a side of rice. They asked her to check doneness before she started eating to make sure it was cooked perfectly, which we appreciated. I got the  Parilla Sonora which came with American wagyu, beans, and an Anaheim chile relleno. It was delicious! Both steaks had the perfect seasoning, but with the hot stones it over cooked. Especially my American wagyu because they were thinner slices. I'd recommend getting the steak cooked a bit less than you normally would then let the stone cook it to your liking. \n\nFor dessert, my wife got the arroz con leche and I got the flan flight. Both desserts were really good. The flan flight came with a corn flan, a chocolate flan, and a cheesecake like flan.

We were promptly seated as per our reservation. We were then presented with a selection of citrus and additions we could customize our water with. Great touch and way to set the tone of the meal. \n\nWe ordered the guacamole to start and then 3 main dishes and a baked potato to share for 4. \n\nThe guacamole was good! Straightforward, well seasoned. No complaints. It came with bread and crackers. I think it also came with an array of salsas. Unsure whether that accompanied the guac or the meal. But we needed the salsa to finish the bread/crackers. Guac was fully consumed since we came hungry.\n\nThe steaks arrived next. Our server answered all our questions before and after serving about our steaks. We ordered the Vasio medium and the El Zabuton medium rare. We took it off the sizzle plate once they came to stop the cooking. The Vasio was our favorite steak of the night. We needed to add salt but were provided rock salt so it was a bit tricky. Salsas provided were great in enhancing and complimenting the flavor of the meat.\n\nThe baked potato was a bit of a let down for me since I got to it mid-steak and the cheese had congealed. It didn't enhance my experience much. \n\nThe Carne Asada was okay! There were tortillas provided that seemed handmade. Great light texture. The meat was decent but since it was so thin, it's at risk of getting a bit tough. There was a lot of meat on that plate too, good portion but compared to the steaks, this was not the star of the night. If you get this one as your only main, it's a good pick. \n\nAll in all, loved the service, ambience and food. We sat for a while as we picked off the remaining bites of food and never felt rushed by service.

But the brusselsprouts, were crispy, sweet, and savory. I really enjoyed the flavor of the brusselsprouts appetizer. \n\nThe duck sotbap was buttery, addicting. We initially forgot to add/mix the gochujang into the dish and thought initially that while buttery it was a bit bland. But once we added the gochujang, it was well seasoned and the flavors played well together. \n\nThe lobster ramen, however, was quite bland. The lobster itself was well seasoned and sizable. But the noodles and soup could've been better seasoned. It wasn't deep in flavor either. \n\nThe star of the show was definitely the desserts. If I could come back for the desserts only I would. \n\nThe ginger crème brûlée from the description sounds a bit weird. But the ginger is subtle, and I couldn't taste dwenjang in the caramel. All the flavors combine well to produce a sweet and creamy dish. It doesn't have that caramelized hardened shell that I was expecting but it was delicious. \n\nThe black sesame is nutty, and not very sweet.

The short rib was so tender and flavorful - it is very expensive for the portion, but we got it during both of our visits with no regrets. Sujebi bolognese has such a unique texture from the sujebi - i would say it is not the same texture as traditional sujebi, but more like rice cake texture that soaks up the delicious sauce. \n\nWe also loved their special, which was perilla truffle noodles - an elevated take on the Korean traditional perilla makgguksu.

We were seated right away, I was also very surprised to see that the chef was greeting guests, it's a pleasant surprise! \n\nDisappointingly, I didn't feel like we were very welcomed in the restaurant, just ... cold and quiet HAHA onto the food! \n\nOctopus: My friend recommended I try this dish and it was delicious. The octopus was cooked nicely, the dashima beurre blanc *chef's kiss* almost licked the dish \n\nHamachi Crudo with Nengmyun broth: I was debating between this dish and the steak tartare; with a little encouragement from the server we decided on the yellowtail and I am glad I did! It was a very familiar taste but with unfamiliar combinations? The nengmyun broth and yellowtail harmoniously balanced each other; not one overwhelming the other. \n\nMushrooms: I do not care what you say this is by far the BEST FREAKING thing I ate in Seattle. Please keep in mind this is my review and this is my opinion hehe I LOVED everything about this dish. Literally a flavor festival inside your mouth. Really enjoyed the kimchi inside that gave a punch of tang. I .. took it togo to eat it at the hotel ... HAHHA \n\nBugak: I think this is a dish that can be loved by everybody. Korean elevated taco hehehe\n\nDuck Special: This was not on the menu but was a special that night. The good was that the duck was cooked to perfection, it was pink with the skin nicely grilled and not chewy. It also came with a small side of duck...wellington? duck tarte? THAT was delicious! This dish comes with a few side banchans. \n\nBingsu: I ... want to bring home a TUB of that ginger cream. Dear lawd I was so full but I couldn't stop eating it, I can bathe in that ginger cream HAHA \n\nOverall it was a great dinner. I'm not familiar with the history of Paju but it was just shy of perfection.

As soon as the bartender came up I informed him I was in a rush, ordered a sandwich to-go and a drink for while I wait. He was very friendly and prompt with the drink. Sitting at the counter I saw into the kitchen and noticed all the kitchen staff were just restocking condiments and the steam table (it was slow at the time, there were maybe 2 other tables that already had food). I didn\'t say anything because maybe there was someone cooking mine in the back, IDK. It was a full 10 minutes after my order before someone began cooking my food. I told the bartender to cancel the food and I\'ll pay for the drink since I didn\'t have time for this and he goes ""Uhhh, well, we already started cooking your food"", so I had to be late if I wanted the food I had to pay for. \n\nI want to give them another try because the food was good, but the staff made me miss an apointment so others angry at me and low-key ruined my afternoon.

I asked our server what she would recommend that will knock my socks off like the old dish did. She recommended the burnt ends and man!!!! they did not disappoint. We also ordered fried oysters and they were delicious. This spot consistently makes the most ridiculously delicious food that pairs well with their whiskeys. Awesome selection. And if you're not a whiskey fan and prefer tequila, they have you covered. My buddy ordered a Fortaleza anejo and I have to say..

Restaurant Recommendation Service: Project Requirements Document

1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a recommendation service that leverages the Yelp Fusion API to extract restaurant data and integrates with Claude AI to provide personalized restaurant recommendations based on user-specified criteria.

2. Objectives
* Create a system that retrieves relevant restaurant data from the Yelp Fusion API
* Process and structure this data for input into Claude AI
* Develop a mechanism for Claude AI to analyze the data and generate personalized recommendations
* Deliver recommendations based on user-specified criteria including price and rating

3. Technical Requirements
3.1 Data Source
* Yelp Fusion API: Will be used to extract restaurant data including: 
o Restaurant name, location, and contact information
o Price range ($ to $$$$)
o User ratings (1-5 stars)
o Photos
o Reviews
o Categories/cuisine types
o Operating hours

3.2 Integration
* API integration between Yelp Fusion and the application
* Data formatting for Claude AI processing
* Claude AI integration for recommendation generation

3.3 Functionality
* User input collection for criteria specification
* Query formation for Yelp API
* Data processing and structuring
* Recommendation generation via Claude AI
* Results presentation to user

4. User Requirements
4.1 Input Criteria
The system will accept the following criteria from users:
* Price range preferences
* Minimum rating threshold

4.2 Additional Criteria (To be confirmed)
These were mentioned as examples but not specifically confirmed:
* Keywords (e.g., "romantic," "outdoor seating")
* Categories/cuisine type
* Distance/location
* Dietary restrictions
* Operating hours

5. System Architecture
[Basic architecture diagram would be inserted here]
1. User Interface: Collects user preferences
2. API Controller: Forms and sends queries to Yelp API
3. Data Processor: Formats returned data for Claude AI
4. Recommendation Engine: Claude AI processes data and generates recommendations
5. Results Interface: Presents recommendations to user
6. Information Gaps and Questions
1. User Interface: What type of interface will users interact with? (Web application, mobile app, chatbot, etc.)
2. Authentication: How will the system handle Yelp API authentication and rate limits?
3. Location: How will user location be determined for distance-based recommendations?
4. Criteria Priority: How should the system weight different criteria when generating recommendations?
5. Result Format: What information should be included in the recommendations? (Just names, detailed information, links, etc.)
6. Deployment: Where will this service be hosted?
7. User Accounts: Will the system store user preferences or history?
8. Additional Criteria: Are there other criteria beyond price and rating that should be included?
9. Performance Requirements: What are the expectations for response time?
10. Scale: How many users is this system expected to serve?
